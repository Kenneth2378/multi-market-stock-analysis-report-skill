# Multi-Market Stock Report Skill

Codex skill name: `a-share-stock-report`

This project was previously introduced as **Multi-Market Stock Report Skill**. The Codex skill name remains `a-share-stock-report`.

本项目早期曾以 **Multi-Market Stock Report Skill** 介绍；为兼容老用户，Codex 调用名仍为 `a-share-stock-report`。

一个用于生成 A股、B股、港股和美股股票研究 PDF 报告的 Codex Skill，覆盖基本面、估值、技术面、公开量价资金推断、消息情绪和研究判断框架。仅供学习研究，不构成投资建议。

A Codex Skill for generating deep PDF stock research reports across A-shares, B-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks, covering fundamentals, valuation, technical analysis, public price-volume inference, news sentiment, and a research judgment framework. For research and learning only. Not investment advice.

The public repository includes the deterministic research-pack renderer, report validator, privacy scanner, and HTML template. Local generated reports remain private and ignored.

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing prompts continue to work.
- The default behavior is a deep stock research PDF report with a sibling quality check.
- The public Codex skill name remains `a-share-stock-report`.
- Each report should generate a sibling `quality_check.md`.

## Public Community Scope

This public version supports:

- Deep, source-backed stock research PDF reports.
- A-share, B-share, Hong Kong stock, and US stock research.
- Recent three-month price and volume chart.
- Fundamentals, valuation, technical analysis, news/sentiment, and public price-volume inference.
- Research judgment and methodology.
- Observation conditions, invalidation conditions, and risk warnings.
- Numeric validation gate.
- `quality_check.md`.
- Data-source citation, copyright boundary, disclaimer, and private-information protection.

## Example Reports

- A-share example: 中际旭创
- US stock example: NVIDIA
- Stable income example: 京沪高铁

## What This Skill Generates

- PDF stock research report.
- Recent 3-month chart.
- Fundamentals.
- Valuation.
- Technical analysis.
- Public price-volume inference.
- Research judgment framework.
- Observation and invalidation conditions.
- Risk disclaimer.
- `quality_check.md`.

## Deterministic Deep-Report Pipeline

The current standard uses a structured research pack plus deterministic rendering and validation. Updating `SKILL.md` alone is not sufficient.

Required public files:

- `references/legacy_report_contract.md`
- `references/research_depth_gate.md`
- `references/research_pack_schema.md`
- `templates/report_template.html`
- `templates/quality_check_schema.md`
- `scripts/generate_stock_report.py`
- `scripts/validate_report.py`
- `scripts/scan_pdf_privacy.py`
- `scripts/collect_eastmoney_evidence.py`
- `scripts/init_research_pack.py`

Usage:

```text
python scripts/generate_stock_report.py --input research_pack.json --validate-only
python scripts/generate_stock_report.py --input research_pack.json --output-dir reports
```

The generator rejects incomplete research packs. The final validator requires the legacy content contract, at least 3537 extracted PDF characters, target-specific semantic checks, all numeric validation rows to pass, no privacy hits, the latest complete trading day, and no forced page break or sparse non-final page.

## Features

- Resolve stock names, codes, markets, and trading currencies.
- Gather recent market data and financial information.
- Analyze fundamentals, valuation, technical structure, news, sentiment, and observable public price-volume signals.
- Add an evidence-based research judgment with methodology, scenarios, observation conditions, and invalidation conditions.
- Generate Chinese PDF reports with charts.
- Include data sources and risk disclaimers.
- Support market-specific caveats for A股、B股、港股、美股.

## PDF Export Privacy Regression

Chrome or Edge headless PDF exports must disable browser default headers and footers. Prefer:

```text
--no-pdf-header-footer
```

If using Playwright or Puppeteer, explicitly set:

```python
display_header_footer=False
```

After every PDF export, run the hard gate:

```text
python scripts/scan_pdf_privacy.py path/to/report.pdf
```

The generator must write the scan result to the sibling `quality_check.md`, including extractor, privacy keyword list, hit list, and `PDF Privacy Scan` status.

Extract the final PDF text with a reliable extractor and scan it for local paths or credential-like keywords. Do not rely only on HTML/SVG scanning, raw zlib stream scanning, or browser export flags.

Extractor priority:

1. PyMuPDF / fitz
2. pypdf
3. pdfminer.six
4. pdftotext / mutool

Minimum privacy patterns include:

```text
file://
D:/
D:\
C:/
C:\
C:\Users
/Users/
\Users\
api_key
token
cookie
secret
password
```

If any pattern is found in extracted PDF text, `quality_check.md` must mark `PDF Privacy Scan` as `FAIL`, and the final conclusion cannot be `PASS`. If the privacy scan passes but data pending verification fields remain, the final conclusion must be `NEEDS_REVIEW`.

## Numeric Validation Gate

Before producing the final report, the Skill should validate:

- `price x share count = market cap`, with unit and currency checks.
- Latest close, prior close, intraday price, and after-hours price are not mixed.
- YoY, QoQ, and period return are recalculated from source numbers.
- Units are consistent across 亿、万亿、million、billion、trillion.
- PE, PB, PS, market cap, and share-count source bases are stated.
- If data conflicts, label the conflict and do not force a conclusion.
- If key data cannot be verified, write `数据待核验`.

## Installation

Copy this folder into your Codex skills directory:

```text
~/.codex/skills/a-share-stock-report
```

Then restart Codex.

Runtime requirements:

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- Google Chrome, Chromium, or Microsoft Edge for PDF export.
- Internet access for current market data and public filings.

Install the Python dependency before first use:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On a non-standard browser installation, pass its executable path with `--browser` when running `scripts/generate_stock_report.py`.

## Public Evidence Workflow

For A-shares and B-shares, first collect a reproducible public-evidence snapshot:

```text
python scripts/collect_eastmoney_evidence.py --ticker 600845.SH --output workspace/600845_evidence.json
python scripts/init_research_pack.py --evidence workspace/600845_evidence.json --output workspace/600845_research_pack.json
```

The initialized research pack is deliberately marked `数据待核验` and cannot pass generation. Codex must verify the annual report, latest quarterly report, exchange announcements, peers, valuation basis, and every numeric-validation row before removing `pending_verification`.

Then run the deterministic gates:

```text
python scripts/generate_stock_report.py --input workspace/600845_research_pack.json --validate-only
python scripts/generate_stock_report.py --input workspace/600845_research_pack.json --output-dir workspace/reports
```

The collector is an evidence aid, not an investment-analysis engine. Hong Kong and US securities require the public alternatives listed in `SKILL.md`.

## Reproducibility Boundary

The repository fixes the report contract, renderer, numeric trail, semantic checks, privacy scan, and PASS threshold. Live prices, newly published filings, source availability, and model-written analysis can change, so different runs should meet the same validation standard but are not expected to produce identical wording or conclusions.
